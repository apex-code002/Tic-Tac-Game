# Tic-Tac-Game
About the Project

The Advanced Tic Tac Toe Game Using Python is a desktop-based application developed to demonstrate the practical implementation of Python programming, graphical user interface design, and artificial intelligence concepts. Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3×3 grid, where players take turns marking the cells with their respective symbols, X or O. The objective of the game is to form a straight line of three identical symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project enhances the traditional Tic Tac Toe game by incorporating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python’s Tkinter library, making the game more interactive and user-friendly. The system provides two modes of play: Single Player mode, where a human player competes against the computer, and Two Player mode, where two human players can play against each other.

In Single Player mode, the computer opponent is powered by the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm widely used in artificial intelligence for turn-based games. The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible game states and selects the optimal move, ensuring that the computer always plays intelligently and never loses. This makes the game challenging and demonstrates the practical use of artificial intelligence techniques.

The project is modular in design, consisting of separate components for game logic, artificial intelligence, and graphical user interface. This structure improves readability, maintainability, and ease of understanding. The application also includes features such as automatic win and draw detection, input validation, and game restart options.

Overall, this project serves as an effective learning tool for understanding Python programming, GUI development, and basic artificial intelligence concepts. It is suitable as an academic mini-project for diploma and engineering students and provides a strong foundation for further enhancements such as difficulty levels, score tracking, and online multiplayer functionality.
